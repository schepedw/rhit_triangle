        This is an elaborate description of what will happen at the event.
        We'll be going out to do things, and after that, some stuff will occur.
        If you'd like to join, we would be delighted to have you.
        But first, you must meet several qualifications.
        For example, you must be able to tell us how many sides a triangle has.
        Given that you achieve that successfully, you'll need to tell us how
        many degrees there are in a  triangle.
        What's the measure of each angle of an equilateral triangle?
        Do you like scalene or isosceles triangles?
